EPLQ: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Location-Based Query
Overview
EPLQ (Efficient Privacy-Preserving Location-Based Query) is a web application designed to provide secure location-based services (LBS) while preserving user privacy. It allows admins to upload encrypted Points of Interest (POIs) and users to search for nearby POIs without revealing their location to the server. The application uses client-side decryption and filtering to ensure privacy, with data stored securely in Firebase Firestore.
Features

Admin Module: Register, login, and upload encrypted POIs (name, latitude, longitude, description).
User Module: Register, login, and search for POIs within a specified range by decrypting and filtering locally.
Privacy: User location is never sent to the server; POIs are encrypted in the cloud.
Technologies: Next.js (React framework), Firebase (auth and Firestore), CryptoJS (AES encryption), Tailwind CSS (styling).
Deployment: Hosted on Vercel for scalability and ease of access.

Prerequisites

Node.js (v18 or higher)
Firebase account (free tier)
GitHub account for version control
Vercel account for deployment (optional)

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eplq-project.git
cd eplq-project


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Configure Firebase:

Go to Firebase Console.
Create a project (e.g., "eplq-project").
Enable Email/Password authentication.
Create a Firestore database in test mode.
In Project Settings, add a web app and copy the firebaseConfig object.
Generate a service account key (JSON) from Project Settings > Service accounts.
Create .env.local in the project root with the following (replace with your values):NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-apiKey
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-authDomain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-projectId
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storageBucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messagingSenderId
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-appId
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project_id-from-json
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your-private_key_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYourPrivateKeyWithNewlines\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-client_email
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=your-client_id




Run Locally:
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


Project Workflow

Register:

Navigate to /register.
Enter email, password, and select role (admin or user).
Admin role allows uploading POIs; user role allows searching.


Login:

Go to /login and sign in with registered credentials.
Admins are redirected to /admin/upload, users to /user/search.


Admin: Upload POIs:

At /admin/upload, enter POI details (name, latitude, longitude, description).
Data is encrypted client-side and stored in Firestore.


User: Search POIs:

At /user/search, input your latitude, longitude, and search range (in km).
App fetches encrypted POIs, decrypts locally, and filters based on distance (Haversine formula).


Logout:

Sign out to return to the home page.



Execution

Local: Run npm run dev for development.
Production: Deploy to Vercel:
Push code to a public GitHub repo.
Import repo in Vercel dashboard.
Add environment variables (same as .env.local).
Deploy to get a public URL (e.g., eplq-project.vercel.app).



Code Structure

src/lib/firebase.ts: Initializes Firebase client-side (auth, Firestore).
src/lib/firebase-admin.ts: Initializes Firebase Admin SDK for server-side API routes.
src/lib/utils.ts: Contains encryption (AES), decryption, and Haversine distance functions.
src/app/page.tsx: Home page with register/login links.
src/app/register/page.tsx: Registration form for admin/user.
src/app/login/page.tsx: Login form.
src/app/admin/upload/page.tsx: Admin interface for uploading POIs.
src/app/user/search/page.tsx: User interface for searching POIs.
src/app/api/upload/route.ts: API to handle secure POI uploads (admin-only).
src/app/api/pois/route.ts: API to fetch encrypted POIs for users.
.env.local: Environment variables for Firebase config.

Logging

Uses console.log for actions (register, login, upload, search, errors).
Logs are visible in browser console (client-side) or terminal (server-side).

Security and Privacy

User Privacy: User's location and search range are never sent to the server; all filtering is done client-side.
Data Privacy: POIs are encrypted with AES (CryptoJS) before storage in Firestore.
Authentication: Firebase Auth secures user sessions; API routes verify tokens and roles.
Firestore: Test mode for simplicity; production should use rules to restrict access to authenticated users.

Optimizations

Code Level: Modular structure with separate files for components, utilities, and API routes. Reusable encryption/decryption functions.
Architecture Level: Client-side decryption and filtering minimize server load and ensure privacy. Next.js API routes handle secure operations.
Performance: For small datasets (10-50 POIs), search takes ~0.9s on client (matches project goal).

Test Cases

Register Admin: Register with role=admin, verify user doc in Firestore with role.
Login Admin: Login, access /admin/upload (success), /user/search (redirect).
Upload POI: As admin, upload POI, verify encrypted doc in Firestore pois collection.
Register User: Register with role=user.
Login User: Login, access /user/search (success), /admin/upload (redirect).
Search POIs: Input lat=37.7749, lng=-122.4194, range=10km, verify correct POIs displayed.
Invalid Decryption: Tamper encrypted data in Firestore, verify search skips invalid POIs.
Unauthorized Access: As user, attempt to call /api/upload, expect 403 error.
Performance: With 10 POIs, verify search completes in <1 second.
Logout: Sign out, verify redirect to home page.

Deployment Justification

Vercel: Chosen for cloud deployment due to seamless Next.js integration, auto-scaling, and free tier. No need for edge/local deployment as this is a web-based LBS accessible globally.
Firebase: Provides scalable auth and database, with client-side SDK for easy integration and server-side admin SDK for secure API operations.

Challenges

Simplified predicate encryption to basic AES due to time constraints and complexity of research-level crypto in JavaScript.
No advanced tree index; relies on fetching all POIs (suitable for small datasets).
Basic UI to prioritize functionality within short timeline.

Evaluation Metrics

Safe: No harmful operations; secure auth and encryption.
Testable: Modular code supports unit tests (e.g., test encryption, distance calc).
Maintainable: Clear file structure, reusable functions.
Portable: Runs on any OS with Node.js; no OS-specific dependencies.

Technologies

Next.js: React framework for frontend and backend API routes.
Firebase: Authentication and Firestore for user management and POI storage.
CryptoJS: AES encryption for POI data.
Tailwind CSS: Simple, responsive styling.
